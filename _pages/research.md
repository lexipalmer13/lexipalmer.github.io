**Community Effects of Policing in New York City**
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
There has been extensive work on the effect of street level bureaucrats on trust in government and subsequent political participation. However, the majority of this research has focused on direct experiences rather the possibility that communities themselves are changed by their collective interactions with government and continue to perpetuate those norms. I use the overturn of Stop, Question, and Frisk in New York City and a full panel of voter records to add to our understanding of this question. After establishing the negative effect of over zealous policing on propensity to vote, I use voters who move within the city to provide suggestive evidence that living in a community that was heavily policed, even if never directly experienced, continues to depress voting turnout. I extend these findings to non-voting forms of participation as well. These findings suggest that reform of behavior alone is not sufficient to counteract the negative effects of police behavior on communities political participation.

**Books vs Bullets: Measuring Rebel-Provided Services**
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
Despite the growing literature on rebel governance, the difficulty in obtaining reliable data during active conflicts has limited our understanding of internal variation in governance and service provision. This paper uses a within household cohort design drawn from DHS reporting of educational attainment to look at service provision by the Fources Nouvelles in Cote d’Ivoire. This measure if validated by existing surveys on service provision. I test several existing theories around service provision which have contrasting predictions in the current literature, and show that the patterns of provision in this case on consistent with a group focused on building long term, inclusive civilian support rather than short term resource gathering.

**Large Language Models Can Argue in Convincing and Novel Ways About Politics**
*With Arthur Spirling*

[Draft](https://github.com/ArthurSpirling/LargeLanguageArguments)
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
All politics relies on rhetorical appeals. Part creative art, part scientific analysis of what works, the ability to construct persuasive appeals is considered perhaps uniquely human. In recent times however, we have seen successful LLM applications to many such areas of human endeavor. Here, we explore whether these autoregressive transformer approaches can out-compete humans in making political and policy appeals. Our areas of interest include controversial partisan issues in the US, such as abortion and gun rights, but also more banal and open-ended matters. We use a relatively large number of crowdsourced US workers to produce ``best" arguments, and then an open-source LLM to compete with them. Human (crowd) judges make decisions about the relative strength of their (human v machine) efforts. Our results are threefold. First, LLMs can produce arguments on a par with humans, at least in terms of convinces independent judges. That is, LLMs can be persuasive. Second, we show that LLMs produce novel arguments insofar as their output has different quantitative and qualitative characteristics to that produced by humans. LLM arguments are typically easier to read, and written with slightly more positive affectation. But LLM arguments can lack nuance---at least if the goal is to convince others of their merits. Finally, we show that judges mildly prefer human arguments on a given topic. This is true when uninformed about the orator's identity---i.e. human or machine---and becomes more pronounced when they are informed in a randomized controlled experiment.

**The Effectiveness of Narrative Structure at Building Public Support**
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
As many countries note declining trust in government institutions, the academic and public focus is largely on the relationship with government performance. While some existing work points to this being a tenuous connection, there has been minimal attention paid to other methods of persuasion. In this project, I explore one of the ways governments and leaders seek to shift public perceptions: storytelling. I use the case of the main investigative service in Kenya, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, which has been sharing true stories of their cases on Twitter as a way to build trust in the police. Using sentiment classification, I show that following these stories causes people to write more positively about the police. I also build on burgeoning methods for story modeling and generation to test whether adhering to a classic story structure makes these narratives more persuasive. This project aims to contribute to our understanding of how trust develops and whether structure of communication as well as content matters.

**Disaggregating Political Cynicism**
*With Gwyneth McClendon*
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
Political observers have remarked that cynicism is currently very high in the U.S. and have conjectured that high levels of cynicism may be affecting political behavior in important ways. In this paper, we argue that there are at least two dimensions of politically-relevant cynicism that need to be parsed: (1) cynicism about human nature generally and (2) cynicism specifically about political elites. These two dimensions are not highly correlated empirically and they are conceptually distinct: human nature cynicism views all people as selfish and badly intentioned, whereas elite cynicism allows that there is a pool of good people out there, just not in current elite circles. Importantly, these two dimensions have divergent consequences for candidate evaluations and for support for institutional reform. Individuals who are highly cynical about human nature prefer leaders who strategically lie and cheat to get things done now but also believe in the possibility that institutions could reduce lying and cheating and improve government in the future. By contrast, individuals who are highly cynical about elites are not tolerant of leaders’ lying and cheating, instead prefer leaders who engage in forthright, authentic communication, and see getting better people into office rather than institutional reform as the way forward.

**Measuring Narrative Structure and a Selection of Political Applications**
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
Despite work across many fields demonstrating that humans are extremely sensitive to a classic story structure in text, there has yet to be a method to evaluate and quantify to what extent a piece of text fits this structure. In this paper I propose a replicable model to assign a score to a document based on a training set of stories as to whether it follows the ’ideal’ story sequence. I then test this methodology on three types of political stories: personal experiences, institutional functioning, and national identity. This project aims to facilitate a study of the degree to which structure of information matters as well as content by developing a novel text analysis methodology.
