**Reform and Community Level Participation: The Overturn of SQF in New York City**
*(under review)*

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
Though there has been a wealth of work showing that negative experiences with gov- ernment lead to less political participation, there is little understanding of how to address this problem. That is, it is unclear whether reform to negative government behavior can also address the negative consequences of that behavior. This paper uses the overturn of Stop, Question, and Frisk in New York City to show that despite a significant change to police behavior, having experienced a high level of policing continues to depress voter turnout. Further, it uses residents who have moved within New York City after the change in policy to show that residing in a community that was heavily policed continues to influence voter behavior, even if an individual never directly experienced high levels of policing. This is in line with communities both being changed by police policies and community transmission of norms around participation.

**Books vs Bullets: Measuring Rebel-Provided Services**
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
Despite the growing literature on rebel governance, the difficulty in obtaining reliable data during active conflicts has limited our understanding of internal variation in governance and service provision. This paper uses a within household cohort design drawn from DHS reporting of educational attainment to look at service provision by the Fources Nouvelles in Cote d’Ivoire. This measure if validated by existing surveys on service provision. I test several existing theories around service provision which have contrasting predictions in the current literature, and show that the patterns of provision in this case on consistent with a group focused on building long term, inclusive civilian support rather than short term resource gathering.

**Large Language Models Can Argue in Convincing and Novel Ways About Politics**
*With Arthur Spirling (under review)*

[Draft](https://github.com/ArthurSpirling/LargeLanguageArguments)
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
All politics relies on rhetorical appeals. Part creative art, part engineering, the ability to be politically persuasive is considered perhaps uniquely human. But recent times have seen successful large language model (LLM) applications to many such areas of endeavor. Here, we explore whether these transformer approaches can out-compete humans in making political and policy appeals. Our areas of interest include controversial partisan issues in the US, such as abortion and immigration, but also more banal matters. We curate responses from crowdsourced US workers and an open-source LLM to produce “best” arguments and place them in competition with one another. Human (crowd) judges make decisions about the relative strength of their (human v machine) efforts. We have three empirical “possibility” results. First, LLMs are capable of producing arguments on a par with humans, at least in terms of convincing independent judges. Second, we show that LLMs produce novel arguments insofar as their output has different characteristics to that produced by humans. LLM arguments are typically easier to read, and written with slightly more positive affectation. But LLM arguments can lack nuance—at least if the goal is to convince others of their merits. Finally, we demonstrate that while judges initially show no overall preference for human or LLM arguments, they prefer human ones when informed about the orator’s true identity in a randomized controlled experiment.

**The Effectiveness of Narrative Structure at Building Public Support**

[Draft](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/54eue4mri117o5fh6aq66/Palmer_narrative_draft.pdf?rlkey=r6m1mue4hxi2dcekj9g7qdp6m&dl=0)

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
As many countries note declining trust in government institutions, the academic and public discussion has largely focused on the connection between trust and government performance. However, many governments and institutions use other strategies to build trust, including storytelling. Rather than improving government performance or procedures, telling a story (following a rising action-climax-falling action format) can increase empathy towards government representatives and a more positive affect towards institutions. I use the case of the main investigative police service in Kenya, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, which has been sharing stories of their cases on Twitter as a way to build trust in the police. Using sentiment classification, I show that people who follow these stories (rather than straightforward reports of similar police actions) write more positively about the police. I also use data from a survey experiment in Kenya to demonstrate that structuring information as a story increases audience belief that the relevant actors can be trusted. Finally, I compare the effects of a story with elements of procedural justice to establish this strategy is at least as effective as shifting opinions about performance at building trust. This project contributes to our understanding of how trust develops and the effect of structure as compared to content.

**Disaggregating Political Cynicism: Evidence of Two Types of Cynicism and their Attitudinal Consequences**
*With Gwyneth McClendon*
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
Political cynicism is rising around the world, but we have little understanding of the possible consequences or of the origin of these trends. In this paper, we use a novel survey from two very different countries both marked by rising political cynicism (the United States and Kenya), and we distinguish in both places between (a) general cynicism about human nature and (b) cynicism about political elites specifically. We show that these two types of cynicism  are associated with different political preferences. People with a high degree of cynicism about human nature prefer leaders who will lie and cheat to succeed, as there are unlikely to be any better options. In contrast, individuals who are cynical  about elites but not about human nature prefer honest leaders and think electing the best people is a better guard against poor governance than stronger institutional checks. We further show that these two types of cynicism cut across partisan divides, and that social isolation and concerns about group status drive them, rather than concerns about government inaction.

**How to Use Masked Language Models to Classify Narrative Structure in Political Texts**
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
This paper develops an original method for classifying the latent structure of a piece of text using a Masked Language Model to classify the similarity of component parts and then scoring documents by the overall ordering of each category. Though there is a wealth of work categorizing text based on its topic and tone, there is little methodology for sorting text by the way it is structured. This is despite the fact that anyone who speaks or writes thinks carefully about the best order in which to convey information and the subsequent impact on an audience. For instance, relating information as a story rather than in a straightforward man ner has been shown to be more persuasive and increase empathy. However, in contexts where time is limited or an audience is more skeptical, it may be best to lead with the main point. Being able to classify the structure of text will allow us to both understand how politicians convey information and the contexts in which this varies. The benefits of the method include that it can be used on short form documents, which are often more difficult to break into discrete parts, and each stage can be verified by an analyst rather than black-boxing what is being classified.
